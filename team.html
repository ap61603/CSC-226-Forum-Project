        <h3>Step 1: Getting Started</h3>
        <p>We brainstormed ideas and decided to create a class forum with mini-games. We divided tasks and set up our file structure. Our goal is to create an interactive site where ourselves and our classmates will be able to access and create their own posts, play mini-games and more to come!.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Forum Base</h3>
        <p>We built the basic HTML structures that we needed in order to create the mini-games and the forum, started on CSS styling to make the page look more professional, and finally we began planning the logic behind the mini-games. We know it will have to be kept simple.</p>
